Want to race online without the distraction of other racers? Worry no more!

**This is only a client-side mod. This is not a cheat, nor causes any harm to other players.**

<br>

## **Version 1**
Remove all the racers as soon as they join, there is a small window to see who the other racers are. The racers are not returned when the race finishes.
